# About

Elderistic is an iOS application for volunteering. Elders can ask volunteers to do some basic tasks like grocery or medicine shopping, cleaning, making lunch etc. 
There are three types of users: elders, volunteers and organizations. The organizations assign tasks to volunteers and they make sure that both elders and volunteers are being decent. 


# Features
This iOS app depending on the role you have lets you:
- Elder: make a request for you tasks, view, edit and delete your requests, get details about the assigned volunteer, rate and comment the volunteer after the task is finished
- Volunteer: enter/edit your free hours, accept/reject tasks, get details for the task (plus navigation to the elder's location), get details about the assigned elder, rate and comment the elder after the task is finished
- Organization: match volunteers with tasks, view both elder's and volunteer's ratings and comments
It supports dark and light theme, as well as English and Macedonian language.
